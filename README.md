# Clone_coding

## Development direction
```sh
I practiced HTML and CSS by cloning two popular web pages,
one being the Google website and the other being the Spotify homepage.
Both websites have relatively simple structures,
but they provided a good opportunity to practice
adding some animation effects using CSS hover functionality.
